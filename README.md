## Android development

Newsly attempts to make use of the latest Android libraries and best practices:
* Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (including [Rxjava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)) with [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) for code style
* Makes use of [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/), including:
  * All appropriate [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/arch/), including **Lifecycles**, **Navigation** 
  * Mvp Architecture
  * [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout) 2.0.
  * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) for more fluent use of Android APIs
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)/[OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for networking
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for image loading
* [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection
* Designed and built using Material Design [tools](https://material.io/tools/) and [components](https://material.io/develop/android/)
